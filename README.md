- 👋 Hi, I’m @MilkeCrow
- 👀 I’m interested in: erotic art, movies, manga, animation, MMORPGs, communicating with Copilot, the I Ching (excluding Confucius’s commentary), traditional Chinese medicine (planning to study it with a schedule), stargazing (occasionally), football, jogging, meditation (mindfulness) (inspired by a well-written TV series), and more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about AI and LLMs, with a focus on mathematics and code. Currently applying MCP in my studies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: new AI technologies, creative coding, and sharing knowledge in my areas of interest.

- ⚡ Fun fact: “People achieve the future by resisting the past”—this is my favorite quote of 2025.

My favorite things include exploring the boundaries of creativity and technology, and staying curious about the world. May the Force be with you. I strive to always stand on the positive side, and when feeling down, I try to let go a little.
